# Ideas and suggestions for sixth form computer science curriculum:
- Project-based learning 

- I know of a student who had a year long project to build and programme say autonomous vehicle. This included use of Arduino, and later RaspberryPi, learning python and applying engineering and computing principles. Implementing something similar (could be shorter duration) can help students apply what they learn in the classroom in a practical and creative way. They had a race at the end of every week to see who programmed thei## car the best.

# Real life applications 
- Tying all learning back to real life applications is very beneficial for students as some computing concepts are very abstract and often difficult to see the benefit of
- One suggestion could be to have a chapter in every module focusing on real life applications of what students learned.
- Invite guest lecturer/industry expert every week to talk about an application of an engineering principle we learned about on the course
